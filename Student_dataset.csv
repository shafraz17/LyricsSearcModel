Immortal Technique,Dance with the Devil,2001,hardcore,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William His primary concern was makin' a million Bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams A corrupted young mind at the age of 13 Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder He started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects He was fascinated by material objects But he understood money never bought respect He built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal I don't project my insecurities on other people He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed Dancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed But he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed You might also like Everyone tryin' to be trife, never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot  So Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew Startin' fights over little shit up on the block Stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock Workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot Hit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine Fulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain Tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love They told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die Standin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes Billy realized that these men were well-guarded And they wanted to test him before business started Suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted So now he had a choice between goin' back to his life Or makin' money with made men up in the cyph' His dreams about cars and ice made him agree A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three Everyone tryin' to be trife, never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot  They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin' Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone Three in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home And so they quietly got out the car and followed her Walkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground Screamin', Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around! The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin' They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin' Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently And then they all proceeded to rape her violently Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn Rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned When they were done and she was layin' Bloody, broken and bruised One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22 They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head I'm fallin' and I can't turn back I'm fallin' and I can't turn back  Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice And he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter 'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother She looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her She cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate His corruption had successfully changed his fate And he remembered how his mom used to come home late Workin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth? He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth And cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared But only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true 'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows And every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow He could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked White, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever  Oh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh? Well, it’s not, you didn’t count on a fallen angel gettin' back Into the grace of God and comin' after you Y’all niggas ain’t shit, your producers ain’t shit Your fuckin' A & R ain’t shit I’ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off!

Vinnie Paz,You Can’t Be Neutral on a Moving Train,2012,hardcore,"Governments lie all the time. Well, not just the American government, it's just in the nature of governments. Well, they have to lie. And since they don't represent the people, and so since they act against the interest of the people, the only way they can hold power is if they lie to the people...  You don't know what I know You can't see the spreading stain of deception I am cruel to myself Things will never be the same If they told people the truth, they wouldn't last very long.  I will hold my silence Like a weapon in my hand If I used it I would murder myself You could never understand  Columbus came ashore, greeted with nothin' but niceness Sailin' west in attempt to find gold and spices Dominated by the popes in frenzy for ices The Catholic church expelled Jews and claimed it was righteous The first man to see land would get a reward And get a yearly pension for life, clearly from God A young sailor saw land, said, We isn't far! Columbus lied, said he saw it the evening before They touched ground, they were greeted by the Arawak Columbus had them locked up as prisoners in an hour flat He wanted to find they source of gold and that was that And when they thought that wasn't fair then he stabbed they back When there was no more gold, he took slaves instead And left a quarter million Indians in Haiti dead The men died in mines, the women died at work The children died from lack of milk and they died in the dirt They were just takin' advantage of a passive people They were just bein' the savages of massive evil That's the church work, that's the path of massive ego That's the blood of Abraham bein' stabbed by the steeple You might also like In 1619 they were patiently waitin' For a ship that carried slaves that was changin' the nation The white man was a cannibal, prayin' to Satan Hatred, contempt, the pity of patronization That's the cornerstone everything racism based in The African had a more advanced civilization Black was slave, master was white, rationalization Fifty million dead, that's Western civilization At first they appeared in the north And they were helpless in the face of superior force And all of them were chained together, they really was lost Racism isn't natural, it's merely divorce Before the slave trade, black was considered distasteful By the Oxford dictionary, I find it disgraceful It's not a natural tendency to be bitter and hateful It's the natural enemy of the critical staple Slavery grew as the plantation system grew The reason for that's kinda easily traceable Society of helpless dependence was capable Of saying, Fuck a slave master! You in slavery too!  Seven slaves were put to death for murderin' Master Fear of slave revolt had them developin' faster You a Cataline killer, ineloquent bastard I would burn the white man while smellin' the ashes From time to time, white man was part of the resistance White indentured servants wanted no part of the system King Philip's War showed that if people would listen Then they could maybe break the complex chain of oppression Tyranny is tyranny, but that's a concession But the women, they was treated like that of possessions Black women had it worse 'cause they was abused That's the white justification, the Aryan blues The next move was to dominate the Mexicans James Polk dominated them like they was next of kin He sent Colonel Cross to lie to them and let them in Eleven days later his skull was crushed, so message sent We take nothing by conquest, that was the mantra The military wasn't human, they was just monsters Henry David Thoreau refused to pay his taxes Denounced the Mexican War and got locked in shackles The twentieth century opened, anger re-emerged Reality of ordinary life was bein' heard Anarchists and feminists came from factory work Communism, socialism, seemed to be re-birthed “War is the health of the state” is what Bourne said And if you was born around that time, you was born dead The Espionage Act had people confused 'Cause it was double talk, and they ain’t know how it’d be used Supposedly it was an act against spyin' Dubois knew that that was bullshit and they was lyin' Charles Schenck was arrested in Philadelphia For printin' and distributin' leaflets 'cause they was helpin' ya He was indicted, tried and then found guilty And spent six months in jail, don’t that sound silly? Had his freedom taken away by his own nation But there’s a lesson, do not submit to intimidation The act still exists today and this shit is real Supposedly, Kennedy tried to have that shit appealed Eugene Debs did ten years for no purpose He obstructed the recruiting and enlistment service  The post office started takin' mail privileges Of magazines who printed anti-war sentiments A Socialist named Fairchild had it right He said that, “They can shoot me, but they can’t make me fight! They sentenced him to a year in jail and that was reckless Sixty-five thousand men, conscientious objectors They were sent to army bases to work there They were treated sadistically and were hurt there They were strangled with the hemp rope till they collapsed And officers punched they stomach and they lower back A garden hose was placed on they face with a nozzle About six inches from them so they couldn’t swallow The war ended in nineteen hundred and eighteen The government was just tryin' to wipe the slate clean Hemingway wrote 'Farewell to Arms' Dalton Trumbo wrote 'Johnny Got His Gun' The war was over, but they didn’t learn they lesson Twin tactics of control, reform and repression The patriotic fervor of war had been invoked That’s why the country that you live in is a fuckin' joke! You cannot be neutral on a moving train This is a story about the lies that your teacher told you This is real, actual, factual No lies in the whole record If you don’t believe me, look it up! I’m tryin' to share the shit that I learned with y'all Do the knowledge! Your government does not care about you The people in power do not care about you Understand that! Power to the people!  War is like a fix. You know, you get high on war — “We won! We won! — and then you are down on the ground again and you need another fix, you need another war. Why do you think we’ve had war after war after war after war? Every war, they say: “This is the end. This is the last war.” In World War I, they said: “This is the war to end all wars.” And then, not long after that, was World War II. And then soon the United States was waging war in Korea, and then Vietnam. If you study history, what you learn is that wars are always accompanied by lies. Wars are always accompanied by deception.15Embed"
